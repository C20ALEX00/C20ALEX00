Building backend systems where business rules are explicit, architecture is intentional, and code is designed to scale.

## 🧭 Professional Profile

Backend Developer with production experience contributing to a real SaaS environment at **Brytspace**.

My focus is not just building endpoints —  
it is designing backend systems that:

- Make business logic explicit  
- Separate concerns correctly  
- Remain testable under growth  
- Avoid hidden coupling  
- Scale without collapsing into technical debt  

I work primarily with Django and Django REST Framework, applying service-layer patterns, structured validation, and production-oriented thinking.

## 🏗 Production Experience — Brytspace

At Brytspace, I contributed to a live backend used in production.

My responsibilities included:

- Designing and maintaining REST APIs with Django & DRF  
- Refactoring tightly coupled views into a structured **Service Layer**  
- Moving business rules out of views into serializers and services  
- Writing unit and integration tests for services, serializers and views  
- Detecting and fixing performance issues (e.g. N+1 query problems)  
- Optimizing querysets using `select_related` and `prefetch_related`  
- Reviewing and structuring Pull Requests  
- Monitoring and debugging production errors with **Sentry**  
- Collaborating with frontend to deliver complete feature pipelines  

I approach backend development as system design, not just feature implementation.

## 🧠 How I Think About Backend Architecture

When implementing a feature, I deliberately:

1. Identify and isolate the business rule  
2. Decide where that rule belongs (model vs serializer vs service)  
3. Ensure side effects are controlled and explicit  
4. Write or adapt tests before expanding complexity  
5. Evaluate performance and query behavior  
6. Refactor for clarity before merging  

I optimize for long-term maintainability over short-term speed.

## ⚙️ Technical Strengths

- REST API design with clear resource boundaries  
- Business logic isolation using service-layer patterns  
- Validation strategy design in serializers  
- Query optimization and ORM performance awareness  
- Writing testable, deterministic code  
- Refactoring legacy code without breaking behavior  
- Production debugging and error tracing

## 📈 Current Technical Focus

I am actively deepening my understanding of:

- Django internals and request lifecycle  
- Scalable service-oriented backend patterns  
- Query planning and database performance  
- Authentication and secure flows  
- Designing smaller, composable services  

The goal: move from “backend developer” to “backend systems engineer”.
