## 🧭 Professional Focus

Backend Developer with hands-on experience contributing to a real production environment at **Brytspace**.

I focus on building backend systems that are:

- Predictable  
- Testable  
- Maintainable  
- Explicit in their business logic  

My work is centered around structured REST API development using Django and DRF, applying clear separation of responsibilities and strong testing practices.

## 🏗 Production Experience (Brytspace)

- Designed and maintained REST APIs using Django & DRF  
- Refactored tightly coupled logic into a dedicated **Services Layer**  
- Implemented business rules through serializer validations and service logic  
- Wrote unit and integration tests (services, serializers, views)  
- Improved performance by fixing N+1 queries and optimizing querysets  
- Worked with structured Pull Request workflows and code reviews  
- Monitored production errors using **Sentry**  
- Collaborated with frontend to deliver end-to-end features  

I don’t just implement endpoints — I think about where logic belongs and how it scales.

## 🛠 How I Approach Backend Development

When implementing a feature, I typically:

1. Clarify business rules first  
2. Decide where logic should live (model, serializer, service)  
3. Write or update tests  
4. Refactor for clarity and maintainability  
5. Review performance implications  

Structure over shortcuts.

## 🧠 Engineering Principles

Good backend systems should:

- Keep business rules explicit  
- Separate responsibilities clearly  
- Be easy to test  
- Avoid hidden side effects  
- Fail clearly instead of silently  
- Scale without becoming unmaintainable  

Clean structure beats clever code.
