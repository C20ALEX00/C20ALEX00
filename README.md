Building backend systems where business rules are explicit, architecture is intentional, and code is designed to scale.

## 🧭 Professional Profile

Backend Developer with production experience in **Brytspace**, contributing to a live SaaS backend environment.

I focus on building systems that:

- Make business logic explicit  
- Separate concerns correctly  
- Remain testable under growth  
- Avoid hidden coupling  
- Scale without collapsing into technical debt  

Primarily working with Django & DRF, I apply service-layer patterns, structured validation, and production-oriented thinking.

## 🏗 Production Experience — Brytspace

At Brytspace, my responsibilities included:

- Designing and maintaining REST APIs with Django & DRF  
- Refactoring tightly coupled views into a structured **Service Layer**  
- Moving business rules out of views into serializers and services  
- Writing unit and integration tests for services, serializers, and views  
- Detecting and fixing performance issues (N+1 queries, heavy ORM operations)  
- Optimizing querysets using `select_related` & `prefetch_related`  
- Reviewing and structuring Pull Requests  
- Monitoring and debugging production errors with **Sentry**  
- Collaborating with frontend to deliver full end-to-end features  

I treat backend development as **system design**, not just feature implementation.

## 🧠 How I Approach Backend Architecture

When implementing a feature, I:

1. Identify and isolate business rules  
2. Decide where that rule belongs (model, serializer, service)  
3. Ensure side effects are controlled and explicit  
4. Write or adapt tests before expanding complexity  
5. Evaluate performance and query behavior  
6. Refactor for clarity before merging  

I optimize for **long-term maintainability** over short-term speed.
