## 🧭 Professional Focus

Backend developer with experience contributing to a production environment at **Brytspace**.

My work centers around designing REST APIs that are structured, testable, and aligned with real business logic — not just functional endpoints.

I focus on:
- Clear separation of responsibilities
- Explicit business rule implementation
- Strong validation at serializer level
- Service-layer architecture
- Writing testable and maintainable backend code

## 🏗 Production Experience

At Brytspace, I have worked on:

- Designing and maintaining REST APIs using Django & DRF
- Refactoring tightly coupled logic into a structured Services Layer
- Implementing complex business rules in a maintainable way
- Writing unit and integration tests (services, serializers, views)
- Improving performance by fixing N+1 queries and optimizing querysets
- Working with Pull Requests and structured code reviews
- Monitoring runtime errors using Sentry
- Collaborating with frontend to deliver end-to-end features

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

Good backend systems should:

- Make business rules explicit  
- Be easy to test  
- Avoid hidden side effects  
- Fail clearly  
- Scale without becoming unmaintainable  

Structure over shortcuts.
